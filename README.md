## Inspiration

The initial inspiration for this project was an NFT for stickers at UCI called "Petr Drops". This is because of the perceived value of Petr Drops and their uniqueness per design compared other "Petr Drops" This train of thought eventually led to NFTs about other valuable items. One of these items happened to be gift cards. 

After researching the existing industry of online gift cards, I found a niche about creating a system around an NFT gift card. This is because there exist a myriad of fees within the existing gift card industry for vendors who want to publish and distribute their gift cards This is because distribution companies have to cover to security, validation and other common financial institution costs. However, since an NFT is in the Web3 space, it naturally meshes with DeFi blockchain technology which is known for being secure and more economical than existing TradFi alternatives. Building a blockchain system around these NFTs reduces the cost to mint and distribute, incentivizing vendors to create more of these vouchers, possibly at a slight discount to draw in customers without reducing margins. Vouchers are so valuable to businesses because they increase customer retention and businesses directly profit from unused capital ("float") within gift cards that are not fully redeemed. Building Card Sphere is a way to tap into this market of billions of dollars in general accounts across the world.  

## What it does

Fundamentally, Card Sphere is a market place with similar feel to other modern market places like Klarna. However unlike Klarna, Web3 technology on the back end is what facilitates a successful business model without charging high fees towards vendors or users. The prime reason to incentivize initialize usage is the fact that vendors can issue gift cards and vouchers for no extra charge irrespective of cost or experiation date. Users can buy these vouchers, potentially at a discount and earning loyalty rewards as an extra incentive for buying these vouchers. Vendors can then get these funds near instantly with no commission fee where they are free to spend it however they wish. This allows vendors to more readily capitalize on "float" which is money left on gift cards which is not redeemed into goods. After an expiration date, unearned revenue cannot be earned anymore so it is now reported as an asset as the company already received the payment in full. 

Because of various incentives like loyalty points and deals, consumers are more likely to purchase these vouchers. This builds brand retention and loyalty. To capitalize off of this, card sphere also implements a seamless and fee-less trading of vouchers to other users. This simulates buying someone a gift card to an establishment they wish to share. The key is that users remain in the system and invite other people into the system, creating a network effect which is essential to Card Sphere's model of revenue generation.

To be brief, Card Sphere uses user deposits that are not redeemed for vouchers as stake in defi platforms earning yield similar to a high yield savings account or having "float investing" like as is the case for insurance company premiums. Because of this, revenue scales with user deposits. 

In summary, Card Sphere is a unique technology that feels like an enhanced version of Web2 technology powered by a largely Web3 financial framework invisible to the average user. 


## What's next for Card Sphere

The next step for card sphere is to fully implement many of the web3 hooks that are needed to become a successful business such as switching to a cheaper network than test network ethereum by using an app-chain which is an built in house block chain with low transaction fees but high security. Another thing would be to actually implement custodial wallets and yield staking using USDT for revenue generation. 

After implementing the web3 hooks for the basic business model, the goal is to get more users on to the site by introducing Card Sphere to local vendors in high traffic areas with high customer retention like around universities. The goal during this period is growth to sustain the stake based business model.

Eventually I want card sphere to grow into a universal marketplace that people can use anywhere for any local shop of their choosing.
